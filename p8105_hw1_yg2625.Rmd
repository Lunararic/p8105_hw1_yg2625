# Problem 1

1. Here's a random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0,5] distribution,
and I created logical vector, character vector and factor vector as required.

```{r}
## creating data frame
Prob1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = c(vec_numeric > 2),
  vec_char = c("I", "am", "happy", "to", "take", "the", "data", "science", "course", "today"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("T", "F", "T", "F", "T", "F", "T", "T", "F", "F"))
)
